> Teaching is a true calling, and many people feel passionate about helping the next generation learn and grow. Are you considering transitioning into teaching? How about leveling up your credentials in education? Then getting a fast-track teaching degree online is a great way to get your skills into the classroom quickly. Teachers are in demand, and teacher shortages are impacting just about every state in the US. If you want to prepare yourself to pitch in swiftly, consider enrolling in an accelerated teaching degree to become part of the solution.

#### Program Spotlight Style (Hamline University):
> Hamline University offers students two different ways to get their master's degree in teaching quickly. First, if a student is already getting a bachelor's degree in teaching at Hamline, they can obtain their Master of Arts in Education by taking just two additional courses. This pathway allows you to quickly get a graduate degree, which can add to your earnings as a teacher. The MAEd doesn't provide teachers with preparation for initial state licensure. The certificate areas for this program include Adult ESL, Environmental Education, and Autism Spectrum Disorder, among others.

#### Closing Style:
> So, if you were wondering, "Can you get your teaching degree online?" the answer should now be clear! And if your next question was, "How fast can you get a teaching degree online?" the answer is about 1-2 years. If you choose a fast-track teaching degree from our list, your journey to helping students learn can be pretty speedy.

### Sample 2: MAT vs MEd

**URL:** https://www.geteducated.com/careers/mat-vs-med/
**Word Count:** 4,606 words

#### Opening Paragraph:
> Getting a master's degree in education is a goal for many people but deciding between a MAT vs MEd can be a challenge. The main choice is between the two most popular degrees: the master's in teaching vs master's in education. The Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) is commonly thought of as helping classroom teachers advance their skills, while the Master's in Education (MEd) is assumed to be for those who aspire to administration roles. However, there are specialties and overlaps between the MAT vs MEd that blur the line.

#### Comparison Style:
> For teachers, choosing between an MAT vs MEd degree depends on your goals. While there is no single best master's degree for teachers to get, there are reasons to choose one over the other depending on your goals. Generally, those who want to stay focused on the classroom should choose the master's in teaching vs master's in education, while those who want to move beyond the classroom will be more likely to look at the MEd Degree.

#### Closing Style:
> If you can realize the higher master's in education salary while also benefitting from the added expertise and job prospects, now is a great time to get started down this path. For those who can't decide between the MAT vs MEd, try to remember that it is more what you will learn in your master's than whether you get the master's in teaching vs master's in education degree. A master's degree makes you a master in education, an expert with skills and competencies to share with the world, making our education system stronger so it can serve the many students who are ready to learn!
