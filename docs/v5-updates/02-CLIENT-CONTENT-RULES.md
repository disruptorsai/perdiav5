## Cost Data Rules (CRITICAL)

### Required Source
**ALL cost information must come from GetEducated's ranking reports**

Why?
- Ranking reports include **total cost on enrollment including ALL fees**
- They show both **in-state** and **out-of-state** costs
- Schools cannot opt out of cost publication
- More comprehensive than typical tuition snippets elsewhere

### Ranking Reports Location
- Index: https://www.geteducated.com/online-college-ratings-and-rankings/
- Example: https://www.geteducated.com/online-college-ratings-and-rankings/best-buy-lists/affordable-online-curriculum-instruction-masters-degrees/

### FORBIDDEN Cost Sources
- **NEVER** pull cost data from competitor sites
- **NEVER** pull cost data from school's .edu websites
- **NEVER** use cost estimates or approximations not from ranking reports

## Degree & School Selection Rules

### Selection Criteria
When choosing a school or degree to feature:

1. **MUST be in GetEducated's database**
   - This ensures the degree is offered at least 80% online
   - Degree DB: https://www.geteducated.com/online-degrees/
   - School DB: https://www.geteducated.com/online-schools/

2. **EMPHASIZE "Sponsored Listing" degrees**
   - Look for degrees/schools with logo displayed
   - Look for "Sponsored Listing" verbiage
   - These are paid clients and should be prioritized

### Balance Rule
- Include BOTH paid and unpaid schools in lists (for user value)
- But **never send traffic off-site to non-client schools**
