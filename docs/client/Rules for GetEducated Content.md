“Rules” for Geteducated.com Content 

Content should be about online education, online degrees, and online schools. Topics can cover trending broader education themes but must still be applicable to the online student. 
When pulling online degree program cost information, pull from GetEducated’s published ranking reports as much as possible. We include total cost on enrollment including all fees as well as in state vs out of state cost.

When choosing a school or degree to feature in articles, 1) ensure that the degree or school is in GetEducated’s database (this ensures that the degree is offered at least 80% online) 2) emphasize the degrees that show a logo and have the verbiage “Sponsored Listing” in our degree database.

When discussing a specific degree type (ie an online master’s degree in business), be sure to include links to the degree database. Example: https://www.geteducated.com/online-degrees/master/business/business-administration/
