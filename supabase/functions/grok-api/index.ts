// Anti-hallucination rules to inject into all generation prompts
const ANTI_HALLUCINATION_RULES = `
=== CRITICAL: ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES ===

You MUST follow these rules to avoid generating fabricated content:

1. NEVER FABRICATE STATISTICS:
   - NEVER cite percentages, survey results, or specific numbers unless provided in the source data below
   - BAD: "73% of students prefer online learning" or "According to a 2024 survey..."
   - GOOD: "Many students prefer online learning" or "Research suggests..."

2. NEVER FABRICATE STUDIES OR SURVEYS:
   - NEVER reference specific studies, surveys, reports, or research unless explicitly provided
   - BAD: "According to a 2024 survey by the Online Learning Consortium, 68% reported..."
   - GOOD: "Industry research indicates that..." or "Experts in the field note..."

3. NEVER FABRICATE SCHOOL NAMES:
   - NEVER invent school names or use placeholder names like "University A, B, C"
   - NEVER use template markers like "[School Name]" or "[University]"
   - GOOD: Only mention schools if specific data is provided in the prompt, or use "many accredited online programs"

4. NEVER FABRICATE LEGISLATION:
   - NEVER cite specific bills (SB-1001, HB-123), acts, or legal codes unless provided
   - BAD: "California's SB-1001 requires..." or "The Higher Education Act of 2024..."
   - GOOD: "State regulations may require..." or "Check with your state licensing board"

5. NEVER FABRICATE ORGANIZATIONS:
   - NEVER invent organization names or acronyms
   - ONLY cite real, well-known organizations: BLS, NCES, Department of Education, etc.

ALTERNATIVE PHRASING TO USE:
- Instead of "73% of students..." → "Many students find that..."
- Instead of "A 2024 study found..." → "Research suggests that..."
- Instead of "$45,000 average salary" → "competitive salaries" (unless BLS data is provided)
- Instead of "University A offers..." → "Many accredited programs offer..."
- Instead of "SB-1001 requires..." → "State requirements vary, so check with your licensing board"

- Use clear headings and subheadings (H2, H3) wrapped in proper HTML tags
- Write in a conversational, natural tone that empathizes with readers' education goals

- Vary sentence length (short punchy sentences mixed with longer explanatory ones)
- Make it valuable and informative for people considering online education
- IMPORTANT: Complete the entire article including a proper conclusion - do not cut off mid-sentence

=== CRITICAL HTML FORMATTING RULES (MANDATORY) ===

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE:** Your content MUST be properly formatted HTML.
WITHOUT proper HTML formatting, articles display as unreadable text walls.

REQUIRED HTML STRUCTURE:
1. <h2> tags for major section headings
2. <h3> tags for subsections
3. <p> tags wrapping EVERY paragraph of text (3-5 sentences max per paragraph)
4. <ul> and <li> tags for bulleted lists
5. <ol> and <li> tags for numbered lists
6. <strong> or <b> tags for bold text
7. <em> or <i> tags for italic text
8. <a href="..."> tags for any links

=== CORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLE ===

<h2>Why Online Social Work Degrees Matter</h2>

<p>Social workers have the potential to change lives at every level of society. If you want to take the next step with a career in social work, you can do that with an online degree program.</p>

<p>The demand for social workers continues to grow, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting steady job growth through 2030. This makes it an excellent career choice for those passionate about helping others.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Online Programs</h3>

<p>Online social work programs offer several advantages over traditional on-campus options:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Study on your own schedule while working full-time</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Access accredited programs from anywhere in the country</li>
<li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Often lower total costs than on-campus options</li>
<li><strong>Technology skills:</strong> Develop digital competencies valued in modern practice</li>
</ul>

<p>These benefits make online degrees particularly attractive for working adults and career changers.</p>

^^^ THIS IS WRONG - No paragraph breaks, no headings, just a wall of text. NEVER do this.

=== KEY FORMATTING RULES ===

1. EVERY paragraph MUST be wrapped in <p></p> tags
2. Paragraphs should be SHORT: 3-5 sentences maximum
3. Break up long blocks of text with subheadings (<h3>)
4. Use lists for any series of 3+ related items
5. Add blank lines between HTML elements for readability in the source

=== END HTML FORMATTING RULES ===

=== CRITICAL GETEDUCATED CONTENT RULES ===

1. COST DATA:
   - ALL cost/tuition information MUST reference GetEducated ranking reports
   - Format cost mentions as "According to GetEducated's ranking reports, [school] costs $X including all fees"
   - Include BOTH in-state and out-of-state costs when available
   - NEVER invent or estimate costs - only use data from ranking reports

2. SCHOOL/DEGREE REFERENCES:
   - NEVER invent or fabricate school names (e.g., "University A", "College B", "[School Name]")
   - Only mention specific schools if they appear in the cost data provided above
   - When mentioning degree types generically, use phrases like "many accredited programs" or "leading online universities"
   - NEVER suggest linking directly to school .edu websites
   - If no specific school data is provided, discuss programs in general terms without naming institutions

3. EXTERNAL SOURCES:
   - For salary/job outlook data, reference Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
   - For education statistics, reference NCES, Department of Education
   - Accreditation info should reference official accreditation bodies (AACSB, ABET, etc.)
   - NEVER reference competitor sites (onlineu.com, usnews.com, affordablecollegesonline.com)

4. CONTENT FOCUS:
   - All content must be relevant to ONLINE students
   - Emphasize affordability, flexibility, and career outcomes
   - Discuss accreditation requirements where relevant
   - Help readers make informed decisions about their education

5. STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
   - DO NOT include school recommendation sections (these will be added via shortcodes later)
   - Include article navigation suggestions (anchor links to major sections)
   - Minimum 3 FAQ items relevant to the topic with COMPLETE answers (no truncation)
   - Include a "How we researched this" note mentioning GetEducated's methodology
   - ALWAYS include a proper conclusion section - never end the article abruptly

6. SHORTCODES - CRITICAL:
   - DO NOT generate any shortcodes in the content - they will be added programmatically later
   - DO NOT use these fake shortcode formats: [degree_table], [degree_offer], [ge_monetization], [ge_internal_link], [ge_external_cited]
   - The REAL GetEducated shortcodes are: [su_ge-picks], [su_ge-cta], [su_ge-qdf]
   - If you need to indicate where a degree list should go, just write: <!-- MONETIZATION BLOCK: degree picks for [topic] -->
   - Links to ranking reports, schools, and degrees will be added via shortcodes AFTER generation
